# Results of a multiobjective hydroelectric dam portfolio selection in Myanmar

This is an interactive visualisation of objectives and tracked metrics from a multiobjective optimization study for finding optimal hydroelectric power generation portfolios in Myanmar for a range of hydroelectric power production targets.

The optimization considers 5 objectives: Annual Hydropower Generation, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Loss of Agricultural Land due to impoundment, Loss of Forested Land due to impoundment and Firm Power.

These results are generated as part of the study reported in the paper "Planning low-carbon reservoir investments with spatially-explicit emission models" by Tomasz Janus, Chris Barry, Shelly Win, and Jaise Kuriakose.
